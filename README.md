# CareRoute

CareRoute is an open-source project aimed at building a **transparent, AI-assisted healthcare triage and intelligent doctor-matching platform**.  
The system is designed to support faster, more informed routing of patients to appropriate specialists while keeping **clinicians in the loop** and **AI fully explainable**.

This repository currently contains a **frontend prototype** that demonstrates the patient-side triage flow and interaction model. It does not perform real medical inference and is intended for demonstration and open-source collaboration only.

## Project Status

- **Stage:** Early prototype / demo
- **Current scope:** Client-side UI
- **Planned scope:** Full-stack decision-support system with backend services and interpretable ML

---

## What This Project Is

- AI-assisted **decision-support**, not diagnosis  
- Rule-first, explainable system design  
- Human-in-the-loop healthcare workflows  
- Open-source and community-driven  

---

## What This Project Is NOT

- Not a medical diagnosis system  
- Not a treatment or prescription engine  
- Not a replacement for licensed clinicians  
- Not suitable for real clinical use in its current form  

---

## Current Features (Demo)

- Patient symptom input flow
- Structured triage UI
- Demo-based triage outcomes
- Client-side state persistence using `localStorage`
- Emergency messaging placeholders

All logic is **non-clinical and illustrative**.

---

## Tech Stack (Current)

- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- HTML
- CSS
